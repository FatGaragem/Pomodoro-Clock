# POMODORO CLOCK
## Welcome recruiters and friends.


This is an academic project, whose objective is to test my knowledge in javaScript, OOP and Bootstrap.

According to the goals set by me, this project, in addition to the basic functionality of a pomodoro, should also have reset, pause and continue buttons. It should also have a minimally pleasant interface.

####  It is working in seconds for testing purposes.

##### The code and layout will be improved, but for now this particular game will be paused so I can focus on new projects.
